# Genome_Sequence_Reverter
Software Engineering Team Project

Comment from Suhrab

I just finished the initial page with three functionalities. Functionalities I included are Reverse-Complement, Complement, and Reverse with optimized algorithms. All three functionalities are working without any issues. You can type in any DNA sequence and it will printout the resulted dna sequence. I also made an interesting interactive background for our website composed of A, T, G, C letters (DNA nucleotide letters) floating in the page. There is still some work to do on this page, but overall I like it and if you also think it looks good then we can use these files as template for making the other pages of our website project. I would be happy to hear back from you guys, and it would be nice if you can pick whichever page you would like to complete as well, or what roles you guys are interested in going on with.

P.S. The files are in the reverse-complement branch. For each role and functionality lets create a new branch and commit within those branches.
